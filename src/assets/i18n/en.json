For example, we implement high-standard encryption techniques such as SSL to protect your personal information. Please be advised that we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data you disclose online, due to technical limitations and unforeseeable hostile actions against the platform. By using our service, the user acknowledges the possibility that the system and telecommunication network they use to access our service can be compromised, which is out of our control. For instance, the software the user has downloaded or websites visited may contain viruses or malwares that threaten the security of the wallet information. Therefore, it is imperative that users ensure the security of their personal information and data. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence. The development team recommends that users pay special attention to backing up password and private keys offline (e.g. writing them on a piece of paper).",
